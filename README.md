# Wireless Network Optimization Application

This project provides a graphical tool for modeling, solving, and visualizing wireless network optimization problems. The application supports integer and mixed linear programming formulations, enabling optimization of user-to-Access Point (AP) assignments based on priorities, capacities, and optionally energy consumption.

## Features

- **User and AP management**: Add, remove, and edit users and APs through intuitive tables.  
- **Global settings**: Configure WiFi band, environment type, and optional energy-aware optimization.  
- **Solver integration**: Optimizations solved using Gurobi via a threaded interface for non-blocking execution.  
- **Visualization**:  
  - Network topology with zoomable graphics  
  - AP coverage areas and interference  
  - User-to-AP assignments with priority and energy information  
- **Intermediate calculations**: Display distance, energy, and interference matrices for analysis.  
- **Predefined test cases**: Load and test scenarios quickly with JSON input files.
